# HW12
YOUR ROBOT BUDDY - DUDU(Gesture Controlled Bot)

Summary
DUDU is a TV remote control pull toy and it will looks like a dinosaur. DUDU will move in four direction.(left, right, backward, forward).

Timeline
//Week 1
//Defining the what compponents I need to prepare for buiding the robot. Designing the appearance of the robot.
//Week 2
//Putting every components together and start to upload the code to Arduino and test the robot. Using laser cut to cut out the //appearence of DUDU
Week 3 
Adjustify the code make sure the robot movement route can pair up with the TV remoter. Put the arduino circuit inside the cardboard.
Week 4
Presentation.

Components part
Cardboard for cutting out the apperance for the robot.
Arduino circuit.(IR Sensor, H bridge, Arduino Uno, DC motor with wheels, batteries, jump wire, TV remoter, breadboard.)

Challenge
Arduino is new area to me, so it might need sometimes for me to learn about the circuit building. Also the coding is another 
challenge part for me since I am not sure what kinds arguments or functions I will need for output.
Need to know how's each components fuctioning. 
Need to get more familiar with the output code. 

Need to apply moving left and right to the arduino, also make the movement of the arduino more consistence.(Code is in file "Arduino in progress")
